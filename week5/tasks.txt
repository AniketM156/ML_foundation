2]groupby-aggregate - most popular and least popular artist:
sum the ‘listen_count’
.groupby()

The .groupby method has two important parameters:

i]key_columns, which takes the column we want to group, in our case, ‘artist’

ii]operations, where we define the aggregation operation we using, in our case, we want to sum over the ‘listen_count’.

song_data.groupby(key_columns='artist', operations={'total_count': turicreate.aggregate.SUM('listen_count')})
